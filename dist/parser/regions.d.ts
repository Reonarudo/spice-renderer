/**
 * Language regions of a Spectre netlist (ADR 0009, *Driver and region splitting*). Spectre reads
 * one file in two languages — its own, and SPICE mode — switching at every `simulator lang=`
 * statement (Spectre User Guide 5.1 p.53), so the text is cut into regions before parsing and
 * each region goes to the module of its language: `spectre` or `spectre-spice`. The switch is not
 * scoped by `subckt` or `if`, so block matching stays with the reader, over the concatenated cards.
 *
 * A region's text keeps its place in the file: every line before it is blank, so the cards come
 * back with their real line numbers and no continuation can cross the boundary. The `simulator`
 * line itself belongs to no region.
